# Acknowledgement

The base idea originated from the wonderful
[Regolith project](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/) by
[Bedrock OSS](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS). Features like scripts
([filters](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/guide/filters)) and the
[project structure](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/project-config-standard) are
inspired by Regolith. The [Bedrock Wiki](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/) helped a lot as
well for references like localization and the manifest file format.

[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is used for the documentation website.
Its pretty design and customization support allows us to document Allay in the best
possible way.
