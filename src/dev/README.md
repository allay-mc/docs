# Introduction

In this part of the book we will cover topics that are useful for "developers".
With developer, we mean people who extend the Allay code base or develop software
that extends Allay. One example which will be our first topic is writing scripts.
Earlier, we have discovered how to *use* scripts. Now the Â´*development* of
scripts is discussed. This requires another scope of knowledge because you have
to know how to program. You can use your scripts for yourself or share them
with others.
